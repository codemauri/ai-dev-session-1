# Introduction to Agentic Programming with Claude Code

Welcome to this hands-on tutorial for learning agentic programming! This project demonstrates how to use Claude Code to build a full-stack application by providing clear prompts that guide the AI to create a complete system.

## Project: Recipe Manager

We'll build a Recipe Manager application - a full-stack system that allows users to create, view, update, and delete recipes. This project is perfect for learning because it:

- Demonstrates CRUD operations across the stack
- Shows how to work with relational data (recipes, ingredients, categories)
- Involves frontend, backend, and database integration
- Can be built incrementally with clear milestones
- Uses modern, industry-standard technologies

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework with TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI (modern, fast REST API framework)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (relational database)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose (for local development)
- **Build Tools**: Makefile (for common tasks)

### Features

1. Create, read, update, and delete recipes
2. Manage recipe ingredients and instructions
3. Categorize recipes (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert)
4. Search and filter recipes
5. Rate recipes (optional enhancement)

## Repository Structure

- **main branch**: Contains this README with instructions, stub Makefile, and stub docker-compose.yml
- **solution-1 branch**: Contains a complete working implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need to install these tools:

- **Docker Desktop** (includes Docker Compose V2)
- **Node.js 24+** and **npm**
- **Python 3.13+**
- **Claude Code CLI**
- Basic understanding of REST APIs and web development

**Quick Setup with mise (Recommended):**

This project includes a `.mise.toml` file that automatically manages Node 24 and Python 3.13:

```bash
# Install mise
curl https://mise.run | sh

# Install Node 24 and Python 3.13
mise install

# Verify
mise current
```

See [README-MISE.md](README-MISE.md) for detailed mise usage.

### Installing Prerequisites

#### Option A: Using mise (Recommended for Node.js and Python)

[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) is a modern runtime manager that simplifies installing Node.js and Python.

**Install mise:**
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl https://mise.run | sh

# Or with Homebrew (macOS)
brew install mise

# Add to your shell (follow mise's instructions)
echo 'eval "$(mise activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc  # for bash
echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc    # for zsh
```

**Install Node.js and Python with mise:**
```bash
# Install Node.js 24
mise install node@24
mise use -g node@24

# Install Python 3.13
mise install python@3.13
mise use -g python@3.13

# Verify installations
node --version   # Should show v24.x.x
python --version # Should show 3.13.x
```

**Using mise with this project:**
```bash
# Create .mise.toml in project root
cat > .mise.toml << EOF
[tools]
node = "24"
python = "3.13"
EOF

# mise will automatically use these versions when in the project directory
mise install
```

### Branch Strategy

1. Start on the `main` branch to follow along and build the project yourself
2. Switch to `solution-1` branch to see a complete working solution
3. Compare your implementation with the solution to learn different approaches

## Building the Project with Claude Code

Follow these prompts in order with Claude Code. Each prompt builds on the previous one.

### Prompt 1: Initialize Next.js Frontend

```
Create a new Next.js project in a 'frontend' directory with the following requirements:
- Use TypeScript
- Use the App Router (not Pages Router)
- Include Tailwind CSS for styling
- Set up ESLint
- Create a basic home page with a heading "Recipe Manager"
- Configure the app to run on port 3000
```

### Prompt 2: Initialize FastAPI Backend

```
Create a Python FastAPI backend in a 'backend' directory with:
- Virtual environment setup instructions
- requirements.txt with FastAPI, uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, psycopg[binary] (psycopg3 for Python 3.13 support), python-dotenv, and pydantic
- Basic FastAPI app structure in main.py
- CORS middleware configured to allow requests from http://localhost:3000
- A health check endpoint at GET /health
- Configure the app to run on port 8000
- Add a .env.example file for environment variables
```

### Prompt 3: Set Up PostgreSQL with Docker

#### Original Version (Ambiguous):

```
Create a PostgreSQL database setup:
- Add PostgreSQL service to docker-compose.yml
- Create a .env file with database credentials (DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD)
- Set up SQLAlchemy database connection in backend/database.py
- Create initial database models for:
  - Recipe (id, title, description, instructions, prep_time, cook_time, servings, created_at, updated_at)
  - Category (id, name, description)
  - Ingredient (id, recipe_id, name, amount, unit)
- Create Alembic migrations setup for database schema management
```

> **Note on Prompt Versions:**
> During the first implementation of this tutorial, Prompt 3's final bullet point ("Create Alembic migrations setup") was interpreted as "configure the Alembic infrastructure" rather than "generate actual migration files." This ambiguity led to a non-functional migrations system - the tooling was installed and configured, but no migration files were created, leaving the database empty.
>
> The improved version below demonstrates how to write prompts that eliminate ambiguity by:
> - Using specific commands instead of vague action words
> - Breaking complex tasks into numbered sub-steps
> - Including verification steps to confirm success
> - Specifying expected outputs and file locations
>
> Both versions are provided for comparison to illustrate the importance of prompt precision in agentic programming.

#### Improved Version (Explicit & Unambiguous):

```
Create a PostgreSQL database setup:

1. Add PostgreSQL service to docker-compose.yml
   - Use postgres:16-alpine image
   - Set environment variables: POSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD
   - Create named volume 'postgres_data' for data persistence
   - Expose port 5432
   - Add health check using pg_isready

2. Create environment configuration
   - Create a .env file with database credentials:
     - DB_HOST=db (Docker service name)
     - DB_PORT=5432
     - DB_NAME=recipe_db
     - DB_USER=recipe_user
     - DB_PASSWORD=recipe_password
     - DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://recipe_user:recipe_password@db:5432/recipe_db

3. Set up SQLAlchemy database connection in backend/database.py
   - Import create_engine, declarative_base, sessionmaker from sqlalchemy
   - Read DATABASE_URL from environment using python-dotenv
   - Create engine with DATABASE_URL
   - Create SessionLocal for database sessions
   - Create Base for model declarations
   - Add get_db() dependency function for FastAPI

4. Create SQLAlchemy models in backend/models.py:
   - Recipe model with columns: id (PK), title, description, instructions, prep_time, cook_time, servings, category_id (FK), created_at, updated_at
   - Category model with columns: id (PK), name, description
   - Ingredient model with columns: id (PK), recipe_id (FK), name, amount, unit
   - Define relationships: Recipe.category, Recipe.ingredients, Category.recipes
   - Add __repr__ methods for debugging

5. Set up Alembic for database migrations:
   a. Install Alembic: Add 'alembic>=1.12.0' to requirements.txt

   b. Initialize Alembic structure:
      - Run: `cd backend && alembic init alembic`
      - This creates: alembic/, alembic.ini, alembic/env.py, alembic/versions/

   c. Configure alembic/env.py:
      - Add imports: from database import Base, and import models
      - Set: target_metadata = Base.metadata
      - Load .env and set sqlalchemy.url from environment:
        config.set_main_option("sqlalchemy.url", os.getenv("DATABASE_URL"))

   d. Generate initial migration file:
      - Ensure Docker services are running: `docker compose up -d db`
      - Run: `docker compose exec backend alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial schema - create recipes, categories, ingredients tables"`
      - Verify: Check that a new file appears in backend/alembic/versions/ (format: XXXX_initial_schema.py)
      - Open the file and verify it contains:
        * op.create_table('categories', ...) with columns: id, name, description
        * op.create_table('recipes', ...) with columns: id, title, description, instructions, prep_time, cook_time, servings, category_id, created_at, updated_at
        * op.create_table('ingredients', ...) with columns: id, recipe_id, name, amount, unit
        * Foreign key constraints for recipe_id and category_id

   e. Test the migration system:
      - Apply migration: `docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head`
      - Verify tables exist: `docker compose exec db psql -U recipe_user -d recipe_db -c "\dt"`
      - You should see: categories, recipes, ingredients, alembic_version tables
      - Test rollback: `docker compose exec backend alembic downgrade base`
      - Verify tables removed: `docker compose exec db psql -U recipe_user -d recipe_db -c "\dt"`
      - Re-apply: `docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head`

   f. Document migration commands:
      - Add comments in alembic.ini explaining common commands
      - Note: Migration commands will later be added to Makefile in Prompt 7

6. Verification checklist:
   - [ ] PostgreSQL container starts and passes health check
   - [ ] backend/database.py successfully imports and creates engine
   - [ ] backend/models.py defines all three models with relationships
   - [ ] backend/alembic/versions/ contains at least one migration file
   - [ ] Migration file contains CREATE TABLE statements for all three tables
   - [ ] Running `alembic upgrade head` creates tables in database
   - [ ] Running `alembic current` shows the current migration version
   - [ ] Can connect to database: `psql -h localhost -U recipe_user -d recipe_db` (password: recipe_password)
```

### Prompt 4: Implement REST API Endpoints

```
Implement the following FastAPI endpoints in the backend:
- POST /api/recipes - Create a new recipe
- GET /api/recipes - List all recipes (with optional category filter)
- GET /api/recipes/{id} - Get a specific recipe with ingredients
- PUT /api/recipes/{id} - Update a recipe
- DELETE /api/recipes/{id} - Delete a recipe
- GET /api/categories - List all categories
- POST /api/categories - Create a new category

Include:
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Proper error handling (404, 400, 500)
- Database transactions
- API documentation via FastAPI's automatic Swagger UI
```

### Prompt 5: Create Frontend UI Components

```
Create the frontend UI for the Recipe Manager:
- Recipe list page showing all recipes in a grid/card layout
- Recipe detail page showing full recipe information
- Recipe creation form with fields for title, description, instructions, prep time, cook time, servings, category, and ingredients
- Recipe edit form (can reuse creation form)
- Navigation bar with links to home and create recipe
- Use React hooks for state management
- Implement API calls to the backend using fetch or axios
- Add loading states and error handling
- Style with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern look
```

### Prompt 6: Create Docker Compose Setup

```
Create a complete docker-compose.yml that includes:
- PostgreSQL service with persistent volume
- FastAPI backend service with hot-reload enabled
- Next.js frontend service with hot-reload enabled
- Proper networking between services
- Environment variable configuration
- Health checks for each service
- Expose appropriate ports (3000 for frontend, 8000 for backend, 5432 for postgres)
```

### Prompt 7: Add Makefile for Common Tasks

```
Create a Makefile with the following targets:
- 'make setup' - Initial setup (create .env from .env.example, install dependencies)
- 'make install' - Install frontend and backend dependencies
- 'make dev' - Start all services with Docker Compose
- 'make stop' - Stop all services
- 'make clean' - Clean up containers, volumes, and cache
- 'make migrate' - Run database migrations
- 'make test-backend' - Run backend tests (pytest)
- 'make test-frontend' - Run frontend tests (Jest)
- 'make lint' - Run linters for both frontend and backend
- 'make logs' - View logs from all services
- 'make shell-backend' - Open a shell in the backend container
- 'make shell-db' - Open a psql shell in the database

Include helpful comments explaining what each target does.
Use 'docker compose' (V2 syntax) not 'docker-compose' (V1 syntax).
```

### Prompt 8: Add Testing

```
Add comprehensive testing:

Backend tests (pytest):
- Unit tests for CRUD operations
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Database fixture setup and teardown
- Test configuration with a separate test database

Frontend tests (Jest + React Testing Library):
- Component rendering tests
- Form validation tests
- API interaction mocks
- User interaction tests

Include a conftest.py for backend and jest.config.js for frontend.
```

### Prompt 9: Add Documentation

```
Create comprehensive documentation:
- API documentation (expand on FastAPI's automatic docs)
- Database schema diagram (can be ASCII or instructions for generating)
- Setup and installation guide in SETUP.md
- Architecture overview in ARCHITECTURE.md
- Contributing guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Add inline code comments for complex logic
```
